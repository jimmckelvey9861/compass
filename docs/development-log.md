# Development Log

## Session 2025-07-08 - Professional Environment Setup
**Goal**: Set up Cursor IDE, context preservation, and rebuild scheduling
**Status**: In Progress

### Completed
- [x] Cursor IDE installed and working with GPT-4
- [x] Base Rails app verified working
- [x] Context preservation system created
- [x] AI session context documented

### In Progress
- [ ] Complete documentation system
- [ ] Professional git workflow
- [ ] Interactive scheduling interface rebuild

### Next Steps
1. Finish documentation files
2. Set up proper git branching strategy
3. Begin incremental scheduling feature development
4. Test Cursor AI integration

### Notes
- Lost previous drag-and-drop work due to git reset
- Starting fresh with better development practices
- All basic features confirmed working
- Cursor AI working with GPT-4 out of the box

## Session 2025-07-09 - Interactive Scheduling Development
**Goal**: Build drag-and-drop scheduling interface incrementally
**Status**: Discovery Phase Complete âœ…

### Completed Today
- [x] Verified Cursor AI context system working perfectly
- [x] Examined existing schedule implementation
- [x] Identified solid foundation: grid-based schedule with colored shift bars
- [x] Found existing files: schedule.html.erb and _day_column.html.erb
- [x] Confirmed shifts display with proper positioning and overlap handling

### Current Understanding
- Main schedule view uses CSS grid with time columns and day columns
- Day columns render shifts as absolutely positioned colored bars
- Shifts are sorted and assigned to columns to avoid overlap
- Each shift shows user name, job color, and tooltip details
- Time range dynamically calculated from shifts
- Week/day view toggle already implemented

### Next Steps
1. Add SortableJS library for drag-and-drop
2. Create job palette with draggable job types
3. Convert time slots to drop zones
4. Implement AJAX backend for shift CRUD
5. Add visual feedback and animations

### Notes
- Perfect foundation for drag-and-drop enhancement
- No major structural changes needed
- Can build incrementally on existing code
