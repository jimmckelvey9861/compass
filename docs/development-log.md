# Development Log

## Session 2025-07-08 - Professional Environment Setup
**Goal**: Set up Cursor IDE, context preservation, and rebuild scheduling
**Status**: In Progress

### Completed
- [x] Cursor IDE installed and working with GPT-4
- [x] Base Rails app verified working
- [x] Context preservation system created
- [x] AI session context documented

### In Progress
- [ ] Complete documentation system
- [ ] Professional git workflow
- [ ] Interactive scheduling interface rebuild

### Next Steps
1. Finish documentation files
2. Set up proper git branching strategy
3. Begin incremental scheduling feature development
4. Test Cursor AI integration

### Notes
- Lost previous drag-and-drop work due to git reset
- Starting fresh with better development practices
- All basic features confirmed working
- Cursor AI working with GPT-4 out of the box

## Session 2025-07-09 - Interactive Scheduling Development
**Goal**: Build drag-and-drop scheduling interface incrementally
**Status**: Discovery Phase Complete ✅

### Completed Today
- [x] Verified Cursor AI context system working perfectly
- [x] Examined existing schedule implementation
- [x] Identified solid foundation: grid-based schedule with colored shift bars
- [x] Found existing files: schedule.html.erb and _day_column.html.erb
- [x] Confirmed shifts display with proper positioning and overlap handling

### Current Understanding
- Main schedule view uses CSS grid with time columns and day columns
- Day columns render shifts as absolutely positioned colored bars
- Shifts are sorted and assigned to columns to avoid overlap
- Each shift shows user name, job color, and tooltip details
- Time range dynamically calculated from shifts
- Week/day view toggle already implemented

### Next Steps
1. Add SortableJS library for drag-and-drop
2. Create job palette with draggable job types
3. Convert time slots to drop zones
4. Implement AJAX backend for shift CRUD
5. Add visual feedback and animations

### Notes
- Perfect foundation for drag-and-drop enhancement
- No major structural changes needed
- Can build incrementally on existing code

### ✅ SUCCESS: Complete Importmap Migration by Cursor
**Date**: 2025-07-09
**Challenge**: Full JavaScript architecture migration from asset pipeline to importmap
**Outcome**: Complete success with debugging

**What Cursor Accomplished**:
1. Moved schedule.js from app/assets/javascripts/ to app/javascript/
2. Updated config/importmap.rb (was already correct)
3. Modified app/views/layouts/application.html.erb
4. Removed schedule.js from app/assets/config/manifest.js
5. When migration broke schedule display, diagnosed root cause
6. Identified legacy javascript_include_tag conflict
7. Fixed by removing conflicting asset pipeline reference
8. Restored full functionality

**Key Learning**: 
- Importmap requires explicit imports in application.js
- Cannot mix javascript_include_tag with javascript_importmap_tags
- Cursor capable of complex refactoring AND debugging

**New Architecture**: 
- Pure importmap-based JavaScript
- All JS in app/javascript/ directory
- Standard Rails 7 configuration
- Ready for professional development

### ✅ SUCCESS: JavaScript Architecture Standardized
**Date**: 2025-07-09
**Achievement**: Clean esbuild-based setup implemented

**Final Architecture**:
- **Build System**: esbuild (fast, production-optimized)
- **Entry Point**: app/javascript/application.js
- **Schedule Loading**: Relative import + javascript_include_tag
- **Asset Compilation**: npm run build (JS) + npm run build:css
- **No Conflicts**: Removed importmap/esbuild conflicts

**Key Files**:
- config/importmap.rb: No schedule pin (clean separation)
- app/javascript/application.js: import "./schedule" (relative)
- app/views/layouts/application.html.erb: javascript_include_tag + importmap_tags
- package.json: esbuild scripts working

**Status**: Ready for production, ready for drag-and-drop development

**Performance**: Fast builds, optimized output, professional setup

### ✅ FINAL SUCCESS: Clean Rails 7 + esbuild Architecture
**Date**: 2025-07-09  
**Achievement**: Eliminated all duplicate loading, achieved standard setup

**Final Clean Architecture**:
- **esbuild**: Handles all application code (schedule.js bundled into application.js)
- **Importmap**: Handles only framework libraries (Turbo, Stimulus)
- **No Conflicts**: Zero duplicate loading
- **Standard**: Recognizable Rails 7 + esbuild pattern
- **Production Ready**: Optimized bundling, source maps, clean separation

**Status**: ✅ STANDARDIZED ✅ TESTED ✅ PRODUCTION-READY

**Next**: Ready for drag-and-drop scheduling development
